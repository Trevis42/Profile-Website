          <h2 intro><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
          <p><strong> About me...</strong> I have been interested in <em>technology</em> for many years. </p>
          <p>Over the years I continued to learn and study, hoping to grow in the knowledge to one day better the world around me.
            I started this curiosity with my love of Lego sets and what I could build with them. I was determined to be an engineer in college to my hands on learning and creating.
            When I did go into Mechanical Engineering, I found it not as fun and creative as I had hoped for. I switched to Computer Engineering a year later.
            I enjoyed learn the Electrical Enginnering side of that major but I was really excited and focus more on the Computer Science side.
          </p>
          <p>That led me to want to pursue game design. I started that learning at Lone Star College - Kingwood. They have an amazing Game Design programming focus associate degree path.
            The instructors where great but I found my self enjoying the programming side of that more than the design side. This lead me to focus on programming and get a degree I could utilize in nearly
            any place I would be working -- a Computer Science degree.
