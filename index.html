					<h2 intro><strong>Intro</strong></h2>
					<p><strong> About me...</strong> I have been interested in <em>technology</em> for many years.</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						Over the years I continued to learn and study, hoping to grow in the knowledge to one day better
						the world around me. I started this curiosity with my love of Lego sets and what I could build
						with them. I was determined to be an engineer in college to my hands on learning and creating.
						When I did go into Mechanical Engineering, I found it not as fun and creative as I had hoped
						for. I switched to Computer Engineering a year later. I enjoyed learn the Electrical Enginnering
						side of that major but I was really excited and focus more on the Computer Science side.
					</p>
					<p>
						That led me to want to pursue game design. I started that learning at Lone Star College -
						Kingwood. They have an amazing Game Design programming focus associate degree path. The
						instructors where great but I found my self enjoying the programming side of that more than the
						design side. This lead me to focus on programming and get a degree I could utilize in nearly any
						place I would be working -- a Computer Science degree.
